Meeting with SDG, DP 21/09/15

Hovmoller;
	Heights should be around 1km, 5km, 15km
	Long time, ~3 hours
	Question validity of response

Convergence;
	Difference Hovmollers
	Calc maximum difference at different heights and times, plot
	Plot maxmium distance as a function of different parameters

Transient;
	Converve Heating wrt time. Short time with large magnitude vs long time with small magnitude. 
	

Sensitivity to Heating Function
	Difference plots in Hovmoller
	"thought experiment": increase height of sine (might vary group speed). 


Comments:
	DP;
	Not obvious what the difference will be between wide small and narrow large
	Set grid box of ~25km, have smooth heating over full box - control run. Keep integrated heating the same,
		 play about with parameters. Relate to questions in GCM models.
	Interested in far field response.
	Need to get rotation in. 
	Expecting differences in group speed (?)

	SDG;
	Bear in mind that general integral (with no lid) might answer some of these questions. 
	Try to do this indpendently, thinking about how I can tell the story rather than just doing what they tell me
		 to do (?!?!??@!R<MKNJUH)
	Group Speed: need to think about which one to use (as it depends on k,m.
