Title;
- The Role of Gravity Waves in Conditioning the Remote Troposphere Following Deep Convection
- The Influence of Thermally Forced Gravity Waves on the Remote Troposphere
- Tropospheric Response to Convection Forced Gravity Waves.


Objectives;
- How gravity waves comunicate information in the troposphere when radiation into the stratosphere is enabled. 
- Qualitative changes in the stability of the neighbouring and remote Troposphere due to changes in heating profile.   Specifically, what are the effects of different horizontal length scales and vertical profiles of heating? 
- Consequences of transient heat source. 
- In a radiation system, how Coriolis alters the situation.
